# RawUpdates Demo App 

This is a simple Cordapp to test keeping an external query database in sync with Corda using 
the rawUpdates API. In this pattern, which favours close integration, we accept that if the external system
is unavailable it is better to fail the flow (and force it into the hospital), rather than have a 
second database that is out of sync. Obviously in a distributed system like Corda, 
there are now multiple possible failure and recover modes when updating the external database, 
for example:
* the initiating node fails intermittently 
* a participant node fails intermittently
* multiple nodes fail intermittently within the same flow
* a node fails continuously.


This little CordApp lets us test the failure and recovery modes behave as expected, and also emulate 
the load of multiple client to test for possible race conditions. It is not 
an exhaustive set of scenarios, so please consider the more complicated flows and states that will 
exist in your real world application and add additional logic as necessary.

There is one state, `FooState` and a simple flow, `CreateFoo` that issues new states to two parties, 
partyA and partyB, running the standard finality flow. By changing the action attribute in the FooState, different types of error 
condition in the rawUpdates observer can be emulated. 

Each node starts a simple service, `FooTrackerService` that runs the rawUpdates observer

Each node keeps track of what it has seen and done in a number of text files, 

* **triggered.txt** - records every call to the observer 
* **foo-data.txt** - stores the update that would be stored in the external system, i.e. the successful updates 
* **foo-errors.txt** - stores the update that would have failed in the external system and have throw an exception
* **seen.txt** - internal state for the observer, just to stop it triggering exceptions repeatedly

The helper flows `FindFoo` and `FindFooAcrossNetwork` make it easier to check the state is 
as expected. 

Finally there is a simple command line app, which is normally the easiest way to run.  

## Pre-Requisites

See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.

## Quick Start 

Build using gradle, if in a hurry just 

```bash
./gradlew build -x test
```

Deploy to running Corda nodes, e.g. Alice and Bob (note, will need Corda 4.4)

Edit the connection config `configs/connection.yaml` folder and run with 

```bash
$ java -jar clients/build/libs/clients-0.1.jar configs/example.yaml 
```

Details of what has been communicated to the node are in the `generated.txt` file. If successful, there will
be two entries for each flow and the 'Sent' message contains the flowid.

```bash 
$ cat generated-data.txt 
d9fee9cb-c987-49be-aceb-998d28e845e3,Sending
d9fee9cb-c987-49be-aceb-998d28e845e3,Sent,bb112660-23f1-4b6b-a2d4-8bc9eb0ed786,3894F9C7DFF2A6712BCC5EDF06376258AE5F2D7003C089D558B06CFD1D3B987F
83a0aa11-3c79-49be-a2ae-fde9c32a4255,Sending
83a0aa11-3c79-49be-a2ae-fde9c32a4255,Sent,648d08c8-d686-47a8-8d15-32ac2003f7bd,CD3098948ED067EE405D18C454C4C7368B7742DC878A144CD99D57B38AB7B147
``` 

This calls the `CreateFoo` flow, which simply issues a new FooState to both parties and runs 
the normal Finality Flow. On both nodes the `FooTrackerService`
is stated automatically and will record the data it has received via a rawUpdates observer to the 
csv file `foo-data.txt` in the nodes root folder. A simple example looks like:

```bash
$ cat foodata.txt

```    

where:

* column1 - flowid
* column2 - linearid
* column3 - message
* columm4 - partyA
* columm5 - partyB
* column6 - unix timestamp 

Running the command line with a linearId will dump out details for that state across the both nodes

```bash
$ java -jar clients/build/libs/clients-0.1.jar 0c80749e-a7e9-4a54-83fc-a8d33e6205ca
